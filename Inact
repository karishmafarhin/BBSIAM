Subject: Update on Inactive Repository Cleanup in Bitbucket

Dear Project Teams,

We hope this message finds you well. Recently, we reached out regarding the cleanup of inactive repositories in Bitbucket, particularly those with no commits in over two years.

After further discussion, it has been decided that the management of inactive repositories will remain with the respective project teams. As repository owners, you are best positioned to assess their relevance and determine whether to retain, archive, or delete them.

To assist with this process, please find attached the list of repositories identified as inactive. We kindly ask you to review the list and take the necessary actions to maintain an organized and efficient workspace

Subject: Friendly Reminder: Group Addition Restrictions in Bitbucket

Dear Project Admins,

We hope you're doing well.

As a gentle reminder, adding groups to projects and repositories in Bitbucket is restricted. We have noticed that some new groups have been added despite our previous communication on this. To ensure alignment with our access policies, we kindly request that no new groups be added moving forward. For your reference, we are also sharing our earlier communication on this policy.

Since we have already completed the migration of users from previously existing groups and removed those groups, we will now proceed with migrating users from the newly added groups to individual user assignments. Once this migration is completed, these newly added groups will also be removed.

If you have any concerns or need any assistance with user management, please feel free to reach out.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
