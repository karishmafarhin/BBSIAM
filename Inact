Subject: Update on Inactive Repository Cleanup in Bitbucket

Dear Project Teams,

We hope this message finds you well. Recently, we reached out regarding the cleanup of inactive repositories in Bitbucket, particularly those with no commits in over two years.

After further discussion, it has been decided that the management of inactive repositories will remain with the respective project teams. As repository owners, you are best positioned to assess their relevance and determine whether to retain, archive, or delete them.

To assist with this process, please find attached the list of repositories identified as inactive. We kindly ask you to review the list and take the necessary actions to maintain an organized and efficient workspace
