Got it! Here's the updated problem statement:

**Problem Statement:**
The current version of uDeploy in the production environment has already reached the end of life support from the vendor. This results in significant security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with newer integrations, and the inability to access the latest features and performance improvements. The lack of vendor support means that critical issues cannot be resolved, posing a serious risk to the stability and security of deployment pipelines. An urgent upgrade to the latest supported version is necessary to ensure the continued reliability, security, and efficiency of deployment processes in the production environment.



**Solution:**

1. **Final Preparation:** Review findings from the test and dev environment upgrades. Ensure all backups are ready and dependencies are aligned for production.

2. **Production Upgrade:** Execute the upgrade during a scheduled maintenance window, ensuring all stakeholders are informed. Monitor the process closely for any issues.

3. **Post-Upgrade Validation:** Perform a thorough validation to confirm all production systems are functioning as expected. Address any issues immediately.

4. **Documentation and Monitoring:** Update all relevant documentation and continue monitoring the system for any unexpected behavior in the days following the upgrade.
