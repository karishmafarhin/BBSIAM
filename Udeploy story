Got it! Here's the updated problem statement:

**Problem Statement:**
The current version of uDeploy in the production environment has already reached the end of life support from the vendor. This results in significant security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with newer integrations, and the inability to access the latest features and performance improvements. The lack of vendor support means that critical issues cannot be resolved, posing a serious risk to the stability and security of deployment pipelines. An urgent upgrade to the latest supported version is necessary to ensure the continued reliability, security, and efficiency of deployment processes in the production environment.



**Solution:**

1. **Final Preparation:** Review findings from the test and dev environment upgrades. Ensure all backups are ready and dependencies are aligned for production.

2. **Production Upgrade:** Execute the upgrade during a scheduled maintenance window, ensuring all stakeholders are informed. Monitor the process closely for any issues.

3. **Post-Upgrade Validation:** Perform a thorough validation to confirm all production systems are functioning as expected. Address any issues immediately.

4. **Documentation and Monitoring:** Update all relevant documentation and continue monitoring the system for any unexpected behavior in the days following the upgrade.


**Acceptance Criteria (Updated):**

1. **Successful Upgrade:** The uDeploy version is upgraded in the production environment without critical errors.

2. **Minimal Downtime:** The upgrade is completed within the scheduled maintenance window.

3. **Post-Upgrade Validation:** All deployment processes function correctly, with no regressions. Self-service deployments via CloudBees CD are successfully performed.

4. **ACM Team Validation:** The ACM team validates that WebSphere functionality is operational.

5. **FRA Monitoring:** Daily updates on the FRA size are obtained from the DB team. The restore point is monitored, ensuring it does not reach 100% FRA, which could impact uDeploy.

6. **Restore Points Management:** Restore points are dropped after one week as planned.

7. **No Critical Issues:** No critical issues are identified within 48 hours post-upgrade.

8. **Documentation Updated:** Relevant documentation is updated to reflect the new uDeploy version.

9. **Stakeholder Sign-off:** Stakeholders, including the ACM team, confirm that systems are operating as expected.
