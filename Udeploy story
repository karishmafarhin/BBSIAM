Got it! Here's the updated problem statement:

**Problem Statement:**
The current version of uDeploy in the production environment has already reached the end of life support from the vendor. This results in significant security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with newer integrations, and the inability to access the latest features and performance improvements. The lack of vendor support means that critical issues cannot be resolved, posing a serious risk to the stability and security of deployment pipelines. An urgent upgrade to the latest supported version is necessary to ensure the continued reliability, security, and efficiency of deployment processes in the production environment.
