Task Update:

Plan Status: The plan will be ready by tomorrow for review.

Dependency: We have a dependency on the Unix team to provide the Docker root file details since we don’t have the required permissions to check on a few servers. An incident has been raised with them.

Follow-Up: 
is following up with the Unix team to gather the necessary data. Once we receive this information, we will finalize the plan and the associated change tickets.

Implementation Timeline: Due to these dependencies, we expect to be ready for implementation by next week.
