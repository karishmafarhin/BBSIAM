This attribute, scmAccount, is used in SonarQube to associate a user with one or more SCM (Source Control Management) accounts.

Purpose: It links a SonarQube user to their corresponding SCM accounts, allowing SonarQube to track activity or correlate commits with the user.

How to use: If a user has multiple SCM accounts, you need to call the scmAccount parameter multiple timesâ€”once for each account.

Example:

scmAccount=firstValue
scmAccount=secondValue
scmAccount=thirdValue

In a URL or query string, this would be formatted like:

scmAccount=firstValue&scmAccount=secondValue&scmAccount=thirdValue


This is particularly useful when the same user has multiple SCM identities, e.g., Git, SVN, or other supported SCM tools, ensuring proper mapping across systems.
