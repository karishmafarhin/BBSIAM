Subject: Update on Bitbucket User Access Provisioning via SIAM

Hi [Recipient],

Due to unavoidable circumstances, the SIAM team has postponed the rollout of Bitbucket user access provisioning to January 2025. Until then, please follow the process below for provisioning and deprovisioning user access:

1. Admins can manually manage access by adding or removing users in the project user section or repo user section.


2. Groups must not be added to projects or repositories—only individual user access is allowed.



Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]



Subject: Bitbucket Access Management for SecOps Teams

Hi SecOps Team,

Due to the postponement of the SIAM-managed Bitbucket user access rollout to January 2025, please follow the interim process below:

We have created a new Bitbucket global group for App Security and migrated users from the old GL group to this new global group.

This new group has been added to all projects in Bitbucket.


For any user additions or removals in this group, please contact the DevOps team, who will manage these changes until the SIAM rollout.

Additionally, the user migration from groups to the user section was completed and sent for validation in September, with no access issues reported to date.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
