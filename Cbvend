Dear Team,

We have completed the password rotation activity for the account CDevops-uDeploy in the PROD environment. As part of this process:

1. The password has been updated in all planned releases in CloudBees CD for self-service deployments.


2. The script templates have also been updated to include the new credentials, ensuring that any newly created release will automatically incorporate these updated credentials in the release DSL.



Validation has been performed thoroughly. However, if you encounter any issues during deployments related to this password rotation, please notify me immediately.

Let me know if you need further changes!


Subject: Assistance Required: Granting Access to Modify Pipelines Using Specific Credentials in CloudBees CD

Description:
We are facing an access issue in CloudBees CD related to credentials and their usage in pipelines.

Background:

1. Credentials were created using a specific user account and attached to a project in CloudBees CD.


2. These credentials are being used in pipelines and DSL scripts.


3. We observed that only the user account that created the credentials has the ability to modify pipelines where these credentials are applied.


4. Other users, even with appropriate project or pipeline permissions, are unable to edit these pipelines due to the restrictions tied to credential ownership.



Requirement:
We need guidance on how to:

Grant edit access to other users for pipelines using these credentials.

Update permissions for existing credentials to allow broader team collaboration without recreating them.

Ensure that this process aligns with best practices for security and credential management.


Please let us know the steps or process to resolve this issue.

Environment Details:

CloudBees CD Version: [Provide version details]

Project and Pipeline Details: [Optional, if required]


Looking forward to your assistance.
