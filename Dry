The dry run of the multi-uDeploy agent setup for uDeploy Prod has been successfully completed. As planned, two new agents are now handling traffic, with requests distributed evenly between them. All scenarios have been validated, and the evidence has been documented. Additionally, the CF CLI8 and Shell upgrades have been completed as scheduled.
