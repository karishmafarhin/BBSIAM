Hereâ€™s the updated content for your Jira story involving the Sauce OnDemand plugin installation:

### **Problem Statement:**
The current Jenkins setup does not have the Sauce OnDemand plugin, which is essential for integrating Sauce Labs with Jenkins pipelines to execute automated cross-browser and mobile testing. Without this plugin, teams are unable to leverage Sauce Labs' cloud-based testing environment directly from Jenkins, leading to manual testing or inefficient testing processes.

### **Solution:**
Install and configure the Sauce OnDemand plugin in Jenkins. Once installed, update the relevant pipeline configurations to enable Sauce Labs integration, allowing the execution of cross-browser and mobile tests. Verify the plugin's functionality by running test jobs to ensure that Jenkins pipelines can communicate with Sauce Labs and execute tests as expected.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Sauce OnDemand plugin is successfully installed in the Jenkins environment.
2. Integration with Sauce Labs is verified through successful execution of test pipelines.
3. Existing pipelines remain unaffected, and no failures are observed due to the plugin installation.
4. Cross-browser and mobile testing can be triggered from Jenkins, with test results accurately reported in Sauce Labs.
5. Relevant team members are notified of the plugin installation and provided with guidelines for updating their pipelines to use Sauce Labs.
