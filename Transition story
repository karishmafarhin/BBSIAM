### **Story Title:** Automate User Collection and Licensed User Migration in Bitbucket

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Manually collecting user information and managing licensed users in Bitbucket is a complex and error-prone process. The need to verify licensed users and migrate them from groups to the user section based on project and repository requirements adds to the administrative burden. This manual approach risks inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and potential security issues due to improper user management.

### **Solution:**

Develop an automated script that will:
1. Collect user data from Bitbucket project and repository groups, as well as from the user section.
2. Check the license status of users within these groups.
3. Migrate licensed users from groups to the user section according to the specific requirements of each project and repository.

This solution will streamline user management by automating the collection, verification, and migration processes, ensuring that only licensed users are appropriately placed in the user section. This automation will reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and improve security and compliance across the Bitbucket environment.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The script should successfully connect to Bitbucket and retrieve user data from all specified project and repository groups.
2. The script should gather user data from the user section of Bitbucket.
3. The script must verify the license status of users in the groups.
4. Only licensed users should be migrated from the groups to the user section, following the project and repository-specific rules.
5. The collected and migrated data should be outputted in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for easy analysis and auditing.
6. The script should handle errors gracefully and provide clear logging for any issues encountered during execution.
7. The automation should be able to run on-demand or be scheduled as needed.
8. The solution should be tested and validated against at least one Bitbucket project and its associated repositories to ensure accuracy and completeness.
