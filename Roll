Subject: Rollout of Bitbucket Access Provisioning via SIAM

Dear Application Teams,

We are excited to announce the rollout of Bitbucket access provisioning via SIAM as part of our continuous effort to streamline and automate access management processes. This change aims to enhance security, improve efficiency, and provide a more seamless experience for access requests and approvals.

What’s Changing:

Bitbucket access requests will now be managed through the SIAM platform.

The provisioning process will be automated, reducing manual intervention and ensuring faster access turnaround times.

All new access requests, modifications, and deprovisioning actions will be routed through SIAM.


Key Benefits:

Improved Security: Automated workflows will ensure adherence to compliance policies and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

Efficiency: Reduced turnaround times for access provisioning.

Traceability: A streamlined audit trail of access requests and approvals for enhanced accountability.


Actions Required:

Moving forward, all Bitbucket access requests should be submitted through the SIAM platform. Please discontinue using any old methods or manual processes for requesting access.

Familiarize yourself with the SIAM platform if you haven’t already done so. Training resources and documentation are available [here/attached].


Rollout Timeline:

Start Date: [Insert Date]

End Date: [Insert Date, if applicable]

Thank you for your attention and support.

Additional Details for Project Creation:

For any new project creation in Bitbucket, application teams must submit an RITM to the DevOps team, including details of the Project Admins.

The DevOps team will create the project in Bitbucket and then raise an RITM to the SIAM team to create the necessary SIAM Roles.

The SIAM team will create these roles and map the provided admins as Role Owners.




Don’ts for Project Admins:

Do not add users manually: Project Admins must not add any user manually to either Projects or Repositories, even if they have the access to do so.

Security Violations: Any manual additions will be tracked as security violations, and appropriate actions may be taken as per compliance policies.

All access must go through the SIAM platform to ensure compliance and proper tracking.
