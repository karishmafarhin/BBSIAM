Subject: Issue with Indexing Resolved Post Nexus Data Migration

Hi Team,

We have successfully troubleshooted and resolved the issue related to indexing that occurred with multiple proxy repositories after the Nexus data migration. The issue has been fixed by rebuilding the index, invalidating the cache, and restoring the respective blobstore from storage and the database.

Additionally, we conducted a thorough validation of the following build types by turning off the cache for the respective repositories and dependencies:

1. Maven


2. Gradle


3. Python


4. Node.js


5. React.js


6. Proxy


7. Docker



We have also validated the functionalities of the Nexus IQ integration to ensure everything is working as expected.

Please feel free to reach out if any issues arise.

Best regards,
