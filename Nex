Subject: Issue with Indexing Resolved Post Nexus Data Migration

Hi Team,

We have successfully troubleshooted and resolved the issue related to indexing that occurred with multiple proxy repositories after the Nexus data migration. The issue has been fixed by rebuilding the index, invalidating the cache, and restoring the respective blobstore from storage and the database.

Additionally, we conducted a thorough validation of the following build types by turning off the cache for the respective repositories and dependencies:

1. Maven


2. Gradle


3. Python


4. Node.js


5. React.js


6. Proxy


7. Docker



We have also validated the functionalities of the Nexus IQ integration to ensure everything is working as expected.

Please feel free to reach out if any issues arise.

Best regards,

Subject: Nexus Data Migration: Indexing Issue Resolved with Comprehensive Actions and Validation

Hi Team,

I’m happy to inform you that we have successfully identified and resolved the indexing issue that occurred with multiple proxy repositories after the Nexus data migration from SAN to NAS. Through careful troubleshooting, we implemented the following key actions:

Rebuilt the index to ensure all repositories were correctly indexed.

Invalidated the cache to remove any stale data causing inconsistencies.

Restored the respective blobstore from both storage and the database to ensure data integrity and proper repository functioning.


Comprehensive Validation:

We performed rigorous testing and validation by turning off caching for the following build types:

1. Maven


2. Gradle


3. Python


4. Node.js


5. React.js


6. Proxy


7. Docker



We also validated the Nexus IQ integration to ensure all components are fully functional and in sync post-migration.

Potential Additional Solutions Explored:

As part of our thorough troubleshooting, we considered and explored additional solutions, including:

Re-indexing specific repositories individually to isolate the issue in case it was localized to certain repositories.

Clearing Nexus repository metadata for affected proxy repositories to force a full metadata rebuild.

Optimizing blobstore configurations to ensure efficient data access and reduce potential latency or bottlenecks post-migration.

Database-level checks and optimizations, including possible recalculations of repository metadata, to verify data consistency.


Fortunately, the issue was resolved through the rebuild and cache invalidation steps, but these additional measures were kept on standby as part of our recovery strategy.

Ongoing Monitoring:

We are closely monitoring for any potential pipeline failures and ensuring that everything remains in optimal working order. Please feel free to reach out if any further validation or support is required.
