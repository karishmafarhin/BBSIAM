**Problem Statement:**  
The team requires integration between Jenkins and ALM Octane to streamline Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes. Currently, there is no direct way to track and manage CI/CD pipelines, build results, and quality metrics within ALM Octane, leading to inefficiencies in monitoring and reporting.

**Solution:**  
Install the ALM Octane plugin in Jenkins, enabling seamless integration between Jenkins pipelines and ALM Octane. This integration will allow the team to automatically track builds, test results, and deployment status within ALM Octane, enhancing visibility and traceability of the development lifecycle.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The ALM Octane plugin is successfully installed in Jenkins.
2. Jenkins is able to connect to ALM Octane with the appropriate credentials and settings.
3. CI/CD pipeline data, including build results and test metrics, is successfully synchronized with ALM Octane.
4. The team can view and manage Jenkins build data directly within ALM Octane.
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the new integration and usage instructions.
